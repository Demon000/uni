input:

first line: number of cities (n)
second line: distances between the first city and all the other cities (n real values)
third line: distances between the second city and all the other cities (n real values)
...
n + 1 line: distances between the n-th city and all the other cities (n real values)


solution:
first line: number of cities (n)
second line: the optimal traversing path (indexes of cities, starting by 1)
third line: the length of the optimal path (real value)
